\ufeffHello Jay,

The problem was on my end, I printed a label on my end with the incorrect package dimensions which caused the label to get rejected for insufficient \xa0postage and your package was returned to me. So I had to rebuy a new label with the correct dimensions for the package and resend it.

Hey nick im curious as to what the postage issue was? Was it something on my end? I noticed the tracking has changed and Iâ€™m not sure as to what the problem is. If you could help me clarify this that would be awesome
